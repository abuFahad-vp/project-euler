/*This does not require programming at all. Compute the prime factorization of each number from 1 to 20, and multiply the greatest power of each prime together:

20 = 2^2 * 5
19 = 19
18 = 2 * 3^2
17 = 17
16 = 2^4
15 = 3 * 5
14 = 2 * 7
13 = 13
11 = 11

All others are included in the previous numbers.

ANSWER: 2^4 * 3^2 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 17 * 19 = 232 792 560*/


/*
This question doesn't need programming at all.

prime factors of 2520 = 2^3,3^2,5,7

By combining the prime numbers above we can make all other numbers from 1-10

Similarly, All the other numbers from 1-20 can be made from prime numbers between 1-20
