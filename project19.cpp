/*Why would one just compute 1200/7 to find the number of first days of the month that fell on a Sunday in 100 years? 
There are 1200 first days of the month in 100 years, as there are 1200 months. 
One in every 7 days is a Sunday. 
There is enough regularity to make things essentially nonrandom. 
Of course this argument gets one an approximate answer only.*/
